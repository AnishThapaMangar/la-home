<p><BOLD>Dracaena trifasciata, commonly known as the Snake Plant or Mother-in-law's Tongue, is a popular and resilient indoor plant that belongs to the Asparagaceae family. Native to West Africa, it has gained widespread popularity as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care. The name "Snake Plant" is derived from the plant's long, upright leaves that resemble the shape of a snake, while the alternative name, "Mother-in-law's Tongue," is possibly attributed to the sharpness of the leaves.</BOLD></p>
<h3><big><bold><u>PLANT DESCRIPTION:</u></bold></big><h3>
<p>Snake plant is an erect, clumping, broadleaf evergreen houseplant in the Asparagaceae (asparagus) family. It is native to Africa. Place in a location where it will receive direct sunlight only part of the day, 2 to 6 hours, as it will tolerate very low light. Well-drained soil and careful watering is a must; do not overwater, as the roots will rot. In spring to autumn allow the soil to dry between waterings. In winter only water every one to two months. It tolerates low humidity and cool temperatures around 50 degrees. This plant is quite durable, easily grown, and difficult to kill.

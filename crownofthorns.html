The small inconspicuous flowers are borne in paired clusters and are surrounded by two showy light red bracts. It is a plant that grows in tropical climates. It is also known as the thorny acacia. Various forms are available with yellow or deep red bracts. The white milky sap is poisonous and can cause skin and eye irritation.

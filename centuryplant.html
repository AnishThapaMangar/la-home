<p><BOLD>The century plant (Agave americana L.) is a perennial succulent herb, up to 10 m tall when flowering. It is native to Mexico and to the Southern USA, and its has been introduced in all warm areas around the world as an ornemental.Agave comes from the greek Î±Î³Î±Ï…Î®, which means "noble" or "admirable".Agave americana is a monocarpic species and thus dies after fruiting. It blooms only once, after about 10 years in warm climates, or up to 35 years or more in cool climates.Agave americana is planted as a hedge plant along contours to stabilize platforms and to prevent or control erosion, and for reclamation of denuded and overgrazed land. It is planted as a barrier to prevent fire dispersion.</BOLD></p>
<h3><big><bold><u>PLANT DESCRIPTION:</u></bold></big><h3>
<p>The century plant forms a massive rosette of 20-40 succulent leaves, growing from a short and thick stem close to the ground. The rosette can be as wide as 5 m in diameter. The leaves are 15-25 cm wide and 1-2 m long, smooth and tough, nearly rigid, with a deep gutter that often causes them to recurve at the tip. They have serrated edges, and straight or curved thorns, and a large, sharp apical thorn. The leaf margin is undulate with dark brown teeth that turn grey with age. The leaves of cultivated forms are often grey to grey-blue with horizontal stripes on the back, but there are dark green forms and variegated ones with numerous and inconstant colour patterns.The stalks are eaten by deer, squirrels, and many other animals, and the flower nectar is consumed by hummingbirds and bats in exchange for pollination.</p>
